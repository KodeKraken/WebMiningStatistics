# WebMiningStatistics

This is a program that extracts sports data out of the internet and calculates statistical data for chance of winning when you select sports teams.
The program is in an early build, so any helpful advice on the improvement of the program.
You can use the code freely for copying or inspiration, if it helped you a donation is very much appreciated
I am a student, I live in europe so some parts of the program prints are in my native language.

For running the program you will need:
- Dearpygui (user-interface library)
- Senenium (Web crawler)
- Matplotlib (Graphical data presenting)

- Written in Python
